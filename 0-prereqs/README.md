# Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need to ensure that you have the required tools installed on your computer. You will need:

## 1. A working internet connection

Docker needs to download container images from Docker Hub, which is a public repository for...right, Docker images. Ensure that you have a working connection before beginning the exercises.

## 2. The text editor of your choice

We recommend VSCode, which is available for most platforms: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

You may also want to install the Docker extension for VSCode, which adds syntax highlighting and a few other nice tools. You can read more about installing extensions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

## 3. Install docker

Official install guides are available for [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install).

When your installation has completed, try running the following command in a terminal:

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

If you see the following lines in your output your docker installation is working correctly!

```sh
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

 You are now ready to start with [Chapter 1](../1-basics/)!
